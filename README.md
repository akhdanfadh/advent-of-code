# Advent of Code

To quote the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2025's explanation:

> *Advent of Code* is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in [any](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code) programming language you like.
> People use them as interview prep, company training, [university](https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home) [coursework](https://gribblelab.org/teaching/scicomp2021/index.html), [practice](https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584) [problems](https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/), a speed contest, or to [challenge each other](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&restrict_sr=on).

This repo is my approach to the beloved problems there.
Shout out and big thanks to the author, [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz)!
